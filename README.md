# Smartphone-data-analysis
The project involved the cleaning, processing, and analysis of a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which contained raw data on smartphones, their details, and their ratings. 
The dataset was initially in a highly unstructured and impure form, with multiple duplicate values, unsorted values in different columns and rows, and characters that needed to be cleaned.
To begin the project, the dataset was thoroughly cleaned and processed to remove any duplicate entries, incorrect or inconsistent data, and irrelevant variables. This was followed by a detailed analysis of the cleaned dataset to generate valuable insights and trends related to the smartphone industry.
Some of the insights generated from the analysis include:
Identification of the highest-rated operating systems in both Android and iOS, which are Android v10.0, v11, v12 and IOS 15, IOS 15.0, IOS 16, respectively.
Identification of the highest-rated phone from iOS, which is the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max (1 TB) with a rating of 86/100. This device comes with a price of 1,79,900 and features a Bionic A15, Hexa Core, 3.33 GHz processor, 6 GB RAM, 1 TB inbuilt storage, and a 4352 mAh battery with fast charging.
Identification of multiple options for the highest-rated phone from Android, which include the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 with a price of 1,10,999, Snapdragon 888, Octa Core, 2.84GHz Processor, 12GB RAM, 256GB inbuilt storage, and a 4400mAh battery with 25W fast charging. Other options for the highest-rated phone from Android include the Samsung Galaxy A53 (8GB RAM + 256GB) with a price of 36,499, and the Samsung Galaxy A53 5G (8GB RAM + 128GB) with a price of 33,499.
Overall, the project provided valuable insights into the smartphone industry, enabling manufacturers and marketers to understand the market trends and customer preferences better. It also helped in identifying the best-rated smartphones and operating systems in both iOS and Android, which can help customers in making informed purchase decisions.
